   hi!!! i know we had a tough time and you've been through a lot especially, but i thought maybe making this
   for you would cheer you up a little bit, so i just wanted to say happy valentine's day! i hope your day 
   will be fun despite the fact that you have to work at the shop and i hope that you earn enough money to buy
   that pair of truey jeans that you like so much. if i had the money to i would buy you loads of nice gifts
   too. anyways enjoy reading this bullshit

        i think you already know that i like your looks a lot <:3 
        one specific thing i always found nice about your eyes is that a lot of the time 
        they look clueless, like when i spoke to you in class for the first time you just turned around 
        and gave me a wide surprised 
        stare ^o^ i also notice it in pictures as well, even when you try to look all serious
        when i zoom in you still have the silly look in your eyes. even my mum pointed it out 
        and said that your eyes look very innocent. ^u^ your hands are 
        cute too, every time i see them i get the same feeling over and over again because they're so so 
        adorable >0< ♡♡♡ they're the only hands i wanna hold even if they're all sweaty.  
        your palms are soft and squishy (just like the rest of you) and i'd gladly hold 
        them forever if i could. óuò you also
        look cool when you put your hands in your pockets, i remember seeing you do that a lot 
        in lineup (i miss having you there <:( ) and it's even more cool if you've got a hood
        on cause then you look just a little bit intimidating. but to be honest you'll always
        be a cutie ^U^ you're big, soft and squishy like a plushie. if you were a pusheen plushie
        you'd definitely be the best one.

        i had fun on all of our dates, but my favorite one was the <u> movie date </u> because <br>
        i got to sit really close to you for a long time, to hold your hand, to lean on you <br>
        and to caress your thigh. and yeah the fnaf movie wasn't even that great, but i remember <br>
        myself being really happy when i left the theatre. and plus your outfit was nice.

    that you won't disappoint me and that we'll both be happy in this relationship. you're not
    a nuisance and you're not a burden, just knowing that you're already trying your hardest makes
    everything better and you being sweet helps too. you'll always be a very very different person
    to anybody else. you're my special little star. it's true that no other bond or relationship 
    could be the same as ours and i don't want to find out what a relationship with anyone else
    would be like anyway. i knew you were special since the day i saw you </i>

    <p> if i could wish for one thing, it would be for you would never cry again. it hurts to 
        hear you cry, especially because of conflict with your mum or conflict with me ^n^ 
        i will do everything in my power to try and prevent you from being sad, hurt, angry, anxious, 
        worried, annoyed or depressed. despite you causing problems you still deserve to be 
        very happy so i'll take care of you to my best ability and keep you safe, no matter what that 
        will take (i definitely wouldn't like rip the skin off of anyone who touches you or anything) ^u^ 
        i would never hurt you intentionally. it's really a shame you didn't speak to me earlier about 
        feeling like that, but i can promise you that even when i'm angry i don't want to hurt you. 
        ensuring that you're feeling ok is one of the things i care most about.

    <p class = "purple"> you're the only guy i ever wanna fuck, i mean you already know how horny i am for you but 
        i thought i'd mention it again. it's funny how many times i jerked off while thinking about you and 
        how badly i wanna take your virginity cause despite the fact that i liked a lot of different guys 
        before dating you, i've never been as obsessed with anybody else. the fact that you're such a massive
        cutie and so masculine yet so feminine at the same time is literally the best thing ever. i can never 
        get enough of you, you're the best guy in the world. every single one of your qualities just makes me
        love you more and make me wanna fuck you more. i love you uzair <3
