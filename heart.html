   hi!!! i know we had a tough time and you've been through a lot especially, but i thought maybe making this
   for you would cheer you up a little bit, so i just wanted to say happy valentine's day! i hope your day 
   will be fun despite the fact that you have to work at the shop and i hope that you earn enough money to buy
   that pair of truey jeans that you like so much. if i had the money to i would buy you loads of nice gifts
   too.

        i think you already know that i like your physical appearance a lot too <:3.. 
        one specific thing i always found nice about your eyes is that a lot of the time 
        they look clueless, like when i spoke to youin class for the first time you just turned around 
        and gave me a wide surprised 
        stare ^o^ i also notice it in pictures as well, even when you try to look all serious
        when i zoom in you've still got the same silly look in your eyes ^u^ your hands are 
        cute too. they're the only hands i wanna hold even if they're all sweaty ♡ 
        your palms are soft and squishy (just like the rest of you) and i'd gladly hold 
        them forever if i could. óuò you also
        look cool when you put your hands in your pockets, i remember seeing you do that a lot 
        in lineup (i miss having you there <:( ) and it's even more cool if you've got a hood
        on cause then you look just a little bit intimidating. but to be honest you'll always
        be a cutie ^U^ you're big, soft and squishy like a plushie. if you were a pusheen plushie
        you'd definitely be the best one.

        i had fun on all of our dates, but my favorite one was the <u> movie date </u> because <br>
        i got to sit really close to you for a long time, to hold your hand, to lean on you <br>
        and to caress your thigh. and yeah the fnaf movie wasn't even that great, but i remember <br>
        myself being really happy when i left the theatre. and plus your outfit was nice.

    that you won't disappoint me and that we'll both be happy in this relationship. you're not
    a nuisance and you're not a burden, just knowing that you're already trying your hardest makes
    everything better and you being sweet helps too. you'll always be a very very different person
    to anybody else. you're my special little star. </i>

    <p> if i could wish for one thing, it would be for you would never ever cry again. it hurts to 
        hear you cry and be upset, especially because of conflict with your mum or conflict with me ^n^ 
        i will do everything in my power to try and prevent you from being sad, hurt, angry, anxious, 
        worried, annoyed or depressed. despite all the issues you've caused you still deserve to be 
        very happy so i'll take care of you to my best ability and keep you safe ^u^ i would never 
        hurt you intentionally. it's really a shame you didn't speak to me earlier about feeling like that,
        but i can promise you that even when i'm angry i don't want to hurt you.
